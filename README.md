# Diamond Touch SDK and Applications

For a number of years, I was contracted to make a series of games for the DiamondTouch that showcased it's functionality. This repo contains the source code for three of the games I developed and the latest version of the SDK that I worked with.

The DiamondTouch is a multi-user multi-touch surface. To learn more, visit the following links:

Each game was an Actionscript project wrapped in a C# executable. Touch input was captured in the wrapper and relayed to the embedded Flash applications.

* Matching Mayhem - A four player memory game.
  
* Recycle - A four player recyle sorting exhibit game.
* Water - A four player water conservation exhibit game.
