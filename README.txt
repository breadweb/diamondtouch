Games for the Diamond Touch

For a number of years, I was contracted to make a series of games for the Diamond Touch. This repo contains the source code for three of the games and the latest version of the SDK that I worked with.

The Diamond Touch is a multi-user multi-touch surface. To learn more, visit the following links:

Each game was an Actionscript project wrapped in a C# executable. Touch input was captured in the wrapper layer and relayed to the embedded swf movies.

Matching Mayhem - A four player memory game.
Recycle - A four player recyle sorting exhibit game.
Water - A four player water conservation exhibit game with two displays.
